# type function and type casting.
# type function and type casting tell you what kind of data it is
# for example
# e.g 1
a = 31
t = type(a)
print(t)
# e.g 2
b = 32.5647
y = type(b)
print(y)
# e.g 3
c = "Sumit_Saluja"
u = type(c)
print(u)
# (e.g 4 now we will use str data 
# but will use number to explain that 
# no matter what "" will always be string)
d = "34.76823974"
i = type(d)
print(i)
# (now if we want to chnage the type
# we can do that with below example)
q = "32.4"
w = float(q) #now q is a string but the type we want is float
e = type(w)
print(e)
